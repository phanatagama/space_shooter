# space_shooter
# üí° Project Overview

This is a Flutter project called "space_shooter". It is a game where players control a spaceship and shoot down enemy spaceships.

## Tech Stack

- Flutter: A cross-platform framework for building mobile applications.
- Dart: The programming language used for developing Flutter applications.
- Flame: 2D Game Engine used for game development.

## SpriteComponent

In this project, we utilized the `SpriteComponent` class from the `flame` package. This class is responsible for rendering and animating sprites in the game. It allows us to easily display images, apply transformations, and handle animations for game objects such as the player's spaceship and enemy spaceships.

## SpawnComponent

The `SpawnComponent` class is another component we used in this project. It is responsible for spawning and managing game objects dynamically during gameplay. With the `SpawnComponent`, we were able to create a system that generates enemy spaceships at regular intervals, providing a challenging and dynamic gameplay experience.

By using the `SpriteComponent` and `SpawnComponent`, we were able to create an engaging space shooter game with visually appealing graphics and dynamic enemy spawning.
